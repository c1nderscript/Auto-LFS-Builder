New `<semantic>` version.

<!--
Replace `<semantic>` with "major", "minor", "patch", or "nano" if applicable.
If the update is a new RC (generally frowned upon except for a few packages),
put "release candidate" and don't include "version." Some updates may be weird
and do not follow semantic versioning, NVIDIA being an example. In such a case
just say "New release."
-->

<!-- Not required but recommended: --> **Changelog:**
- Change 1
- Change 2

<!-- Or you can post the link to the changelog made by upstream. -->

<!-- Note if the update fixes security vulnerabilities or there is any special
information about the update that should be known. -->
