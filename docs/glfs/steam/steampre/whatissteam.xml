  <title>What is Steam?</title>

  <para>
    Steam is a set of tools that can purchase, download, and execute a variety
    of games and software, including Windows applications without the need of
    Wine via the Steam tool Proton. This can be a replacement for Wine although
    some applications might not work as expected. Most games are built for
    Windows but most work fine with Proton. It works on regular Linux
    distributions, including LFS without all the setup required for Wine.

  <para>
    As Steam is a complex set of tools that is capable of launching
    complex software, it depends on many tools, libraries, and graphics
    APIs to function and perform as it should.
