  <title>Who Would Want to Read this Book</title>

  <para>
    This book is aimed towards users who want to use a system following
    the Linux From Scratch book but also want to use <application>Steam
    </application> and/or <application>Wine</application>.
    The official Linux From Scratch and Beyond Linux From Scratch books
    do not support these two packages. However, users should still have
    both the choice and an easy to follow guide to get these packages
    working on their system.
