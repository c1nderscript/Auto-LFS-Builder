  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>
    Sometime after my first install of LFS, I had a question that others had:
    how do I install <application>Steam</application> on this system? I kept
    that thought in the back of my head as I went for Beyond LFS, a book that
    covered a good number of packages I needed. However, the issue of
    <application>Steam</application> was not cleared up yet. So I just tried to
    install the <application>Steam</application> tarball. Because I did not
    have 32-bit libraries, this ended in failure.
  </para>

  <para>
    Beyond LFS doesn't cover the installation of Steam, so I had to look
    elsewhere. I learned shortly after my attempt that I needed a multilib
    toolchain. I sent an <ulink
    url="https://lists.linuxfromscratch.org/sympa/arc/blfs-support/2023-03/msg00049.html">email</ulink>
    to the blfs-support mailing list in search of potential multilib support.
    Douglas Reno saw my email and suggested to give Thomas' Multilib branch a
    read. I rebuilt my LFS system with multilib support in mind.

    Rahul Chandra in the same thread mentioned his scripts for his distro,
    Tucana. These scripts gave me a basic idea of how to do lib32 installations
    for BLFS packages which were necessary for
    <application>Steam.</application>. While this wasn't exactly difficult,
    it was a big timesink as I had to manually type in all the lib32
    compilation options to successfully build 32-bit libraries. Even after
    having built all the 32-bit libraries required, a few more fixes and files
    were necessary. After about a week, I managed to get
    <application>Steam</application> working. I realized that this was a lot of
    work, and many users who'd want to do the same thing would get stuck and
    not know what to do. In the worst case, they'd give up before even reaching
    their goal. I had made a pretty lackluster <ulink
    url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ8ueeRZ5q0">YouTube video</ulink>
    explaining some troubleshooting information in an attempt to make things a
    bit easier. Shortly after the video, I realized it wasn't really good
    enough. Knowledge and methods are one thing, but hours spent is another. I
    put my ambitions for an easier guide on my backlog and did other things.

    Sometime afterwards, I decided to do a <ulink
    url="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_vcsK5qbWSv-70zpfFcol_D9yovtf6N6">stream
    series</ulink> that included that installation of
    <application>Wine</application>, not just <application>Steam</application>.
    My general idea was to compile all the stream footage (roughly 40 GB worth)
    into a single video master guide. When some time passed, I came to the
    conclusion that for a installation guide for two complex packages on an LFS
    system, a video is not a great format. I decided to then write up some
    basic <ulink url="../archive/swlfs.html">HTML</ulink>. Rahul Chandra came
    across my <ulink
    url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYrmltSQNdtsbpsbhZI3wg/community?lb=UgkxDlke0llHGWxC7HpzVyv24K8XcsWFF8Dn">YouTube
    post</ulink> and reached out to me. He suggested that I should reuse the
    LFS/BLFS codebase to make my own book. That led to this book's creation
    and editing.
  </para>

  <para>
    Hopefully this book does its job. Have fun, and good luck!
