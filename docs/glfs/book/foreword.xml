  <para>
    This book is separate from LFS/MLFS and BLFS and should be followed after
    LFS/MLFS. If you have already followed BLFS, you will still have to
    reinstall a good number of packages, but you can follow it first before
    following this book. You may also follow this book before moving onto BLFS.
