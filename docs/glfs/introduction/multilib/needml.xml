  <title>Do I Need Multilib?</title>

  <para>
    Now that you have an idea of what multilib is, it is time
    to decide whether to enable that support or not. Depending on the
    circumstance, it may be necessary.

    <title>Steam</title>
    
    <para>
      Most gamers would not know this unless they push the
      limits of the games they play, but many games on Steam
      are 32-bit. Some games are no longer receiving updates
      while some are still being updated but are still 32-bit
      to this day.
    </para>

    <para>
      Not only are a lot of games 32-bit, but Steam itself
      requires that you have 32-bit libraries. If the 32-bit
      libraries aren't on the system, Steam will quit, saying
      it needs a library such as
      <filename class="libraryfile">libc.so.6</filename>.
      You will need the ability to execute 32-bit applications
      as well as all the libraries necessary which is laid out
      in Chapter 3.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Wine</title>
      
    <para>
      Unlike Steam, Wine does not require that you have 32-bit libraries
      or the i686-w64-mingw32 toolchain. Moreover, to get multilib
      support in Wine, it must be compiled twice: a w64 build and a w32
      w/ w64 build. However, it was discussed eariler in the Steam
      section that many games are 32-bit and are no longer maintained or
      will take a while to switch to 64-bit. This is the case with
      Windows applications as well. This means that if you do a 64-bit
      only build, compatabilty for all those 32-bit applications will
      be lost.
    </para>

    <para>
      A Wine WoW64 (can run 32-bit and 64-bit applications) build is
      recommended. You can however skip lib32 and i686 instructions
      to get a pure w64 Wine installation.
