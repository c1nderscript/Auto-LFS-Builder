  <title>Achieving Multilib</title>

  <para>
    On many distros, getting multilib support is very straight
    forward. There exists a guide that can act as a replacement
    for LFS: compiling and configuring a system that can boot,
    run, and compile software; and also have that same ability
    with 32-bit. It acts to form the basis that will allow you
    to follow any of the instructions laid out in the Steam
    and Wine chapters.
  </para>

  <para>
    Such a guide is maintained by Thomas Trepl at
    <ulink url="&mlfs-m32-root;"/>.
    This only covers installing 32-bit support along with 64-bit. If you
    want x32-bit support, which is not needed for this book, follow
    <ulink url="&mlfs-root;"/>.

      First, install <ulink
      url="&blfs-svn;/general/git.html">Git</ulink>, then clone the LFS repo
      and switch to the <computeroutput>multilib</computeroutput> branch:

cd mlfs &amp;&amp;
git checkout multilib</userinput></screen>

      Now inspect the <filename>INSTALL</filename> file to check for the needed
      dependencies in order to render the book. Once you have ensured you have
      installed everything, render the book:

    <para>
      The same principles of compiling for 32-bit in that book will also
      apply to this book as well. If you haven't already, read
      <xref linkend="important"/>
      to check what basic principles still apply in this book when targeting
      32-bit.

      Furthermore, read <xref linkend="which-instructions"/> to find out which
      instructions to follow.
