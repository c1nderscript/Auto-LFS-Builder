  <title>Which Sections of the Book Do I Want?</title>

  <para>
    GLFS stands as a format in between LFS and BLFS so this
    part is crucial to understanding what you need to read and/or
    follow in order to get out of the system that you desire.
    For starters, LFS is meant to be followed in a linear manner,
    whereas BLFS handles things by putting related packages in
    the sections they are best described as categorically.
    For example, printer software being in a printer section,
    although most packages can be discarded by the user.
  </para>

  <para>
    Not every chapter/section will be necessary depending on what you
    want. Some packages may also not be necessary.
  </para>

  <para>
    By default, every user should read the multilib chapter.
    If that chapter is skipped, you might get a headache later on.
  </para>

  <para>
    The following section is Shared Dependencies. Every user
    who wants <application>Steam</application> and/or
    <application>Wine</application> will want to read this chapter
    as both projects use the packages. Most of this chapter is
    necessary. However, it is recommended to check the dependency
    lists of Steam and Wine to see what exactly you need from a
    given section. If you are in doubt, (re)install all of the listed
    packages in that chapter. If you don't use them in this book, it
    still may be useful for some packages in BLFS.
  </para>

  <para>
    The next section is Steam, which covers all the packages,
    patches, configuration, and setup necessary to get
    <application>Steam</application> working and capable of the
    playing the following: Linux games, Windows games via Proton,
    and games using OpenGL, Vulkan, and Direct3D.
  </para>

  <para>
    The following section that most users will need is Wine. Users
    should follow every step in this chapter if they want to install
    WoW64 <application>Wine</application>, but more information is covered
    in that chapter. The Wine chapter at the moment does not consider
    retrofitting and will handle it in a similar manner to Arch: build the
    MinGW-w64 toolchain, install the audio and video components, then finally
    <application>Wine</application> itself.
  </para>

  <para>
    The last section covers quality of life improvements and packages.
    This chapter is not required but recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
    We hope you enjoy using GLFS and that it provides you most of your
    gaming needs!
