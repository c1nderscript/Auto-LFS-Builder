  <title>Important Information</title>

  <para>
    BLFS has more information regarding compilation, /usr vs /usr/local,
    boot scripts, etc. at 
    <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/introduction/important.html"/>.
    Unlike this book, this would be a chapter in BLFS.
    A lot of that information has been omitted as this book is more linear
    and doesn't follow how BLFS follows. However, we will cover some bases
    here.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="which-instructions" xreflabel="Which Instructions to Follow">
    <title>Which Instructions to Follow</title>

    <para>
      This book is different from the main LFS and BLFS books as it also has
      lib32 installation instructions. This is bound to cause confusion.
    </para>

    <para>
      When you see <quote>Installation of ...</quote>, those instructions
      should be followed if you need that package. As you progress, you may
      come across a different format, and the book will instruct you on what to
      follow at that point. You should read <xref linkend="multilib"/> firstly,
      and second, you will probably have to do more than the normal
      installation.
    </para>

    <para>
      This is where the sections labeled
      <quote>lib32 Installation of ...</quote> come in. These sections provide
      32-bit libraries for 32-bit software compatibility, ie. multilib support.
      If you don't need the 32-bit libraries from a given package, you may skip
      the lib32 installation instructions of that package.

    <para revision="sysv">
      This version of this book is meant for SysV LFS systems. The Systemd
      version of the book is not viewable online by &copyholder; due to Github
      Pages restraints. Thus you will need to download or render the book
      yourself. Follow the <ulink url="&glfs-repo;">GLFS rendering
      instructions</ulink> in order to render the book yourself. You will need
      <ulink url='&blfs-svn;/general/git.html'>Git</ulink> to clone the
      repository. You can download the book <ulink
      url="&glfs-repo;/releases">here</ulink>.

    <title>Building software</title>

    <para>
      Building software on GLFS is identical to how it's done in the
      BLFS books, along with having lib32 compilation instructions. It
      goes without saying firstmost that you should have <envar>MAKEFLAGS</envar>
      set to save yourself a lot of time. This is useful for the <command>make
      </command> utility to use the amount of threads that you both want
      and have.
    </para>

<screen><userinput>export MAKEFLAGS='-jx'</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      Replace <option>x</option> with the amount of threads you have.
      You can check the amount of threads you have with:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>grep processor /proc/cpuinfo</userinput></screen>

    <important>
      <para>
        Make sure that you have enough RAM for your system!
        A general method is having 2.5G per thread that is thrown at
        <command>make</command>. For instance, if you want to use 6 threads,
        multiply 6 by 2.5 (which is 15), then make sure you have 15G of RAM.
        If you don't have that RAM, try and limit the threads you throw at
        <command>make</command> or allot swap to meet that requirement.
      </para>
    </important>

    <para>
      Next is compiling for lib32. There are many packages which will have
      a lib32 counterpart. If you just got done with a normal compilation
      of a package and wish to do a lib32 compilation of that same package,
      make sure to clean the directory first:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>make distclean</userinput></screen>

    <para>Or, if you made a build directory, do this in the build
    directory:</para>

    <screen><userinput>rm -rf *</userinput></screen>

    <para>Then proceed with the lib32 compilation instructions.</para>

    <para>
      Generally, the format of targetting lib32 goes like this:
    </para>

    <para>For <command>./configure</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"                  \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib32/pkgconfig          \
./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib32 \
            --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu &amp;&amp;

make &amp;&amp;

make DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR install     &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <para>For <command>meson</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -v build &amp;&amp;
cd       build &amp;&amp;

CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"                     \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib32/pkgconfig             \
meson setup .. --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;

ninja &amp;&amp;

DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR ninja install    &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <para>For <command>cmake</command>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -v build &amp;&amp;
cd       build &amp;&amp;

CC="gcc -m32" CXX="g++ -m32"           \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib32/pkgconfig" \
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr   \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib32 &amp;&amp;

make &amp;&amp;

make DESTDIR=$PWD/DESTDIR install     &amp;&amp;
cp -vr DESTDIR/usr/lib32/* /usr/lib32 &amp;&amp;
rm -rf DESTDIR                        &amp;&amp;
ldconfig</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>
        After you do a DESTDIR installation, it is recommended to
        to use <command>file</command> on one of the libraries in
        <filename>DESTDIR/usr/lib32</filename>. An output of such
        a command for a lib32 build of a library should be
        comparable to the following:
      </para>

<screen><computeroutput>ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked</computeroutput></screen>

      <para>
        Note the <computeroutput>32-bit LSB shared object</computeroutput> part.
        A 64-bit library would show as a <computeroutput>64-bit LSB shared
        object</computeroutput>.
      </para>
