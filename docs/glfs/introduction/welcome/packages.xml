  <title>Getting the Source Packages</title>

  <para>Within the GLFS instructions, each package has two references for
  finding the source files for the package&mdash;an HTTP link and an FTP link
  (some packages may only list one of these links). Every effort has been made
  to ensure that these links are accurate. However, the World Wide Web is in
  continuous flux. Packages are sometimes moved or updated and the exact URL
  specified is not always available.</para>

  <para>The BLFS Team noticed this problem with BLFS, so they, with the
  assistance of Oregon State University Open Source Lab, have made an HTTP/FTP
  site available through world wide mirrors. See <ulink
  url="https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources">
  https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/download.html#sources</ulink> for a
  list. These sites have all the sources of the exact versions of the packages
  used in BLFS. If you can't find the BLFS or GLFS package you need at the
  listed addresses, get it from these sites.</para>

  <para>We would like to ask a favor, however.  Although this is a public
  resource for you to use, please do not abuse it.  They have already had one
  unthinking individual download over 3 GB of data, including multiple copies of
  the same files that are placed at different locations (via symlinks) to make
  finding the right package easier.  This person clearly did not know what files
  he needed and downloaded everything.  The best place to download files
  is the site or sites set up by the source code developer.  Please try
  there first.</para>

  <para>As for GLFS, some packages listed here are not on BLFS or their site.
  In such a case, we do not have a solution at the moment besides going to the
  developer(s) and/or their website.</para>

    <title>Obtaining the Source Packages in Bulk</title>

    <para>
      Obtaining all the source packages all at once is not recommended as
      you will probably pull in packages you won't want. However, it is
      certainly a convenient option if you have the disk space to spare and may
      be necessary if the LFS system cannot download any source code, but
      another system can, such as the host you built the LFS target from.
    </para>

    <note><para>
      This process depends on <xref linkend="wget"/>. It also depends on a
      working internet connection. If you just got done with LFS and are not
      yet booted into the new system yet, then it is recommended to navigate to
      <filename class="directory">$LFS/sources</filename> then follow the below
      instructions on the host system outside of a chroot.
    </para></note>

    <para>
      First navigate to the directory you want the downloaded source code and
      patches to be, then download <ulink url="../wget-list">wget-list</ulink>.
      After that, download the packages and patches by doing the following:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>wget -N --input-file=wget-list --continue</userinput></screen>
