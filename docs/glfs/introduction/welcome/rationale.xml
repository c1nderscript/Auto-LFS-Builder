  <title>Rationale for Packages</title>

  <para>
    Upon reading through some of the sections in this book, you may notice
    that a lot of the packages linked in some of the sections aren't in
    this book but rather in BLFS, some optional dependencies aren't
    listed, some packages may be outdated, and some packages that have test
    suites don't have test instructions. These choices are very much
    deliberate.

    <title>Why Are Many Packages Not in the Book?</title>

    <para>
      Many packages linked on some of the packages' sections aren't in
      the book but rather in the BLFS book. There are multiple reasons
      for this, but the most notable one is the packages that aren't in
      the book aren't important for the main packages in the book, those
      being <application>Steam</application> and
      <application>Wine</application>. They are still listed anyway if users
      want more support out of the specific packages not specific to the main
      packages, like media playback for example. Another reason for
      packages not being in the book is that the packages take a lot
      of work to install and require jumping around. They can also require
      a lot of choice or take up space or RAM for no real benefit for a
      lot of users when there are more simple solutions.

    <title>Why Are Some Optional Dependencies Not Listed?</title>

    <para>
      There are some optional dependencies that aren't listed, and the
      main reason for this is that they just would take up unnecessary
      space. If on the offchance you desire even more out of your system,
      there are plenty more packages in BLFS and BLFS is more geared for
      everyone, although this book focuses more on gaming. Usually the
      optional dependencies that are not listed are those that are needed
      for testing builds and generating documentation.

    <title>Packages That Are Outdated and Why</title>

    <para>
      No packages are currently outdated at time of release.
    </para>

<!--
    <para>
      <xref linkend="mingw-w64-binutils"/>: While
      <application>Binutils</application>-2.44 exists and can be installed
      without issue, on the MinGW-w64 side of things, <xref linkend="wine"/>
      is incompatible with <application>MinGW-w64-Binutils</application>-2.44.
      Mismatched <application>Binutils</application> versions are fine granted
      that one toolchain's version does not match with another but separate
      toolchain's.
    </para>
-->

<!--
    <para>
      <xref linkend="nvidia"/>: Newer versions of <application>NVIDIA
      </application> have many issues. For example, the newest version demands
      that users disable framebuffer emulation support in the kernel in order
      to install and use the driver. The one before that requires a
      <command>sed</command> command after extraction of the runfile.
      <xref linkend="nvidia"/> does not have these issues. Do note that none of
      the GLFS editors use this driver anymore and instead use Nouveau Vulkan
      and Zink Gallium3D from <xref linkend="mesa"/>. It is pretty competent
      now and is recommended to use those drivers instead.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Some Package Test Instructions Aren't Included</title>

    <para>
      Many packages have test suites which can test a given build for
      any potential bugs and may tell you if something has gone wrong.
      However, in GLFS, a lot of these packages have test suites that
      depend on packages that aren't necessary in the book and would
      make this book larger than it needs to be. Furthermore, a lot of
      the packages that do have test suites aren't involved with critical
      components of the system and don't tend to have bugs that
      come up as a result of a build, but rather the released source
      code itself. If you want to do test suites of a given package,
      BLFS has good instructions for that on each package and covers
      all the required dependencies, as well as instructions on how to
      install those dependencies.
