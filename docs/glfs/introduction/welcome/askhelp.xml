  <title>Asking for Help</title>

  <para>
    If you have an issue or need some help, don't be afraid to make
    an issue on <ulink url="https://github.com/glfs-book/glfs/issues"/>.
    Making repeat issues or asking questions that have already been
    answered is alright, but doing some research beforehand is appreciated.
  </para>

  <para>
    GLFS also does not have any mailing lists so making issues is the best
    way to get support or reporting issues with the book.
