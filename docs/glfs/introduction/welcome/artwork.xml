      <para>
        It has been scrapped in GLFS because of the low quality and has no
        transparent background. This is the same reason as a number of
        different legacy images for boxes. Those images were all added and
        scrapped the same day, they just have different purposes and will be
        noted as such.

      <para>
        This one strays from the old design as trying to replicate the hand
        design would prove difficult. Thus, the speech bubble design was
        decided instead. Beyond that, nothing special of note.

      <para>
        Used from June 6th, 2024 to June 25th, 2024.
      </para>

      <para>
        Added by Zeckma on June 6th, 2024, it was the main logo used to
        represent GLFS for a little over two weeks.
      </para>

      <para>
        The main idea behind the design is that the base LFS packages are on
        the gaming computer, and the <quote>G</quote> that sits on top of the
        LFS packages enabled gaming support. The <quote>G</quote> box is much
        bigger than the LFS boxes because it takes a decent amount of packages
        to get gaming support on LFS.
      </para>

      <para>
        Another part of the design was to get away from the puzzle piece
        symbol for different reasons.
      </para>

      <para>
        The creation of this icon was painful and clumsy, but it was to be the
        favicon for the site. It was later replaced by a better logo on June
        25th, 2024 due to how it was simply not an ideal favicon and was hard
        to make out any important details, whereas using the main
        <quote>G</quote> box as the favicon would be painfully plain due to the
        dull colors.

      <para>
        Added by Zeckma on June 25th, 2024, it is the current logo used to
        represent GLFS.
      </para>

      <para>
        It was made to replace the old logo but still have one or two elements
        come over from the old design, the main one being the <quote>G</quote>
        box, although much more stylized. It no longer acts as the favicon for
        the site but shows up at the top of the home page.
      </para>

      <para>
        There isn't much meaning within the logo, although there is some.
        Namely, the dragon and tech elements of the design is meant to convey
        the general theme of gaming. The dragon itself as depicted has its
        gender ambiguous, but nonetheless stoic and focused to better represent
        the wide variety of people that may wish to follow this book.
      </para>

      <para>
        The dragon, or GLFS mascot, does not actually have a name (yet), but
        may recieve one in the future and may recieve more art depicting the
        character.
