  <title>What Drivers to Install</title>

  <para>
    On Linux, there are multiple drivers that one can install. Choosing
    the one you need can be difficult if you do not know what drivers
    are for what vendor and the perks and downsides of each option.
    This section explains all of that to better help you decide what
    you want or need.
  </para>

  <note><para>
    Gallium3D is a technology that <xref linkend="mesa"/> relies on for OpenGL.
    In other words, Gallium3D drivers are just OpenGL drivers. Each Gallium3D
    driver is meant for different systems except
    <computeroutput>zink</computeroutput> which just feeds OpenGL instructions
    to the main Vulkan driver you install for your system.
  </para></note>

  <sect2>
    <title>AMD</title>

    <para>
      There are 3 AMD GPU drivers: AMDGPU (Radeon Southern Islands and later),
      ATI (r300 and r600), and AMDGPU PRO (proprietary AMDGPU driver).
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>AMDGPU</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver is for AMD GPUs that are Southern Island Cards or
      later. It is open source and is the most standard AMD GPU driver.
      This driver is in the Linux kernel. There is one Gallium3D driver,
      <computeroutput>radeonsi</computeroutput>, and one Vulkan driver,
      <computeroutput>amd</computeroutput>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>ATI</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver is for the ATI AMD GPUs which precede GCN GPUs.
      It is open source and targets older GPUs. The driver is in the Linux
      kernel. There are two Gallium3D drivers:
      <computeroutput>r300</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>r600</computeroutput>. For Vulkan, there is one driver,
      <computeroutput>amd</computeroutput>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>AMDGPU PRO</emphasis> (<xref linkend="amdgpu-pro"/>):
      This driver is proprietary. Most users don't install this driver
      as the open source drivers are already well off. However, it is
      needed for hardware acceleration encoding, useful for those who
      wish to record and edit videos. Performance in games varies between
      the open source and proprietary drivers so the ending factor is if
      you record and edit videos or not. You will need the firmware and
      open source kernel driver for this driver.
    </para>

    <para>
      Summary: If you are a regular user with a modern AMD GPU, use
      <emphasis>AMDGPU</emphasis>. If you have an older card, go with
      <emphasis>ATI</emphasis>. Use <emphasis>AMDGPU PRO</emphasis> if
      you want an improvement with hardware acceleration encoding.
    </para>

  <sect2>
    <title>Intel</title>

    <para>
      Intel provides open source drivers, but for sake of simplicity, all
      the relevant open source drivers will be classified as one -
      <emphasis>i915</emphasis>. There is another driver called <emphasis>
      uvesafb</emphasis>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>i915</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver, or rather collection of drivers,
      is for most Intel integrated and discrete GPUs. It is a single option
      in the Linux kernel but has various Gallium3D and Vulkan drivers.
      There is a good list on the <xref linkend="mesa"/> page under
      <quote>Command Explanations</quote> that will explain what Gallium3D and
      Vulkan driver you will need.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>uvesafb</emphasis> (not in this book):
      This driver is for the Intel GMA 3600
      series, a family of integrated video adapters based on the PowerVR
      SGX 545 graphics core. This driver was in the kernel since 3.5 but
      no longer since 4.15. This driver is not included in the book
      because of its lack of use by most people, but has a good Arch Linux
      wiki page at <ulink url="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_GMA_3600"/>.
    </para>

    <title>NVIDIA</title>

    <para>
      The situation revolving around NVIDIA is more unfortunate than
      the two vendors listed above and more complicated. NVIDIA does not
      support open source drivers besides their own open source kernel
      modules. Therefore performance with the open source driver,
      <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis>, is slightly worse than NVIDIA's proprietary
      driver. Installing the proprietary driver can also be easier.
    </para>

    <para>
      <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver is open source but has generally worse performance than
      <emphasis>NVIDIA</emphasis>. The driver is in the Linux kernel. It has
      one Gallium3D driver, <computeroutput>nouveau</computeroutput>, and one
      Vulkan driver, <computeroutput>nouveau</computeroutput>
      <footnote><para>
        The <computeroutput>nouveau</computeroutput> Vulkan driver is also
        known as NVK, although the argument for NVK in
        <parameter>-D vulkan-drivers=</parameter> is just
        <computeroutput>nouveau</computeroutput> and does not have an alias.
      </para></footnote>. The Gallium3D driver is known for its lackluster
      performance. The Vulkan driver is much more performant. For this reason,
      if you want to use <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis>, it is highly recommended
      to install the Vulkan driver as well the
      <computeroutput>zink</computeroutput> Gallium3D driver so that OpenGL
      instructions can be fed into the Vulkan driver.
    </para>

<!--
    <para>
      <emphasis>NVK</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver is a Vulkan driver that is now fairly performant. It targets
      Turing and later NVIDIA GPUs. It does provide much better performance
      than <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis> and is still improving. If you want to
      compile this driver, you are going to need <xref linkend="rustc"/>, and
      if you are doing multilib, are going to need the i686-unknown-linux-gnu
      target. Also make sure to install <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis> if you
      want to install this driver.
    </para>
-->

<!--
    <para>
      <emphasis>Zink</emphasis> (<xref linkend="mesa"/>):
      This driver is a Gallium3D driver converting OpenGL calls to Vulkan
      calls, drastically improving performance. It isn't specifically related
      to <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis> but as performance with
      <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis> is not the best,
      using the <emphasis>Zink</emphasis> driver with
      <emphasis>NVK</emphasis> is a great idea. You can find out how to use
      <emphasis>Zink</emphasis> instead in <xref linkend="whatnow"/>.
    </para>
-->

    <para>
      <emphasis>NVIDIA</emphasis> (<xref linkend="nvidia"/>):
      This is the proprietary driver and the performance of this driver is
      better than the open source alternative. It allows the use of NVIDIA's
      CUDA project which is useful for hardware acceleration, improving
      performance of games and workstation applications. This driver has a lot
      of issues to this day but still provides better performance, thus its
      installation is provided in this book. Firmware isn't needed as it is
      provided by this driver.
    </para>

    <para>
      Summary: If you want good performance and care about workstation use
      cases, install <emphasis>NVIDIA</emphasis>. If you don't want to use the
      proprietary NVIDIA driver, use <emphasis>Nouveau</emphasis>. Installing
      <computeroutput>zink</computeroutput> is a good idea, too.
