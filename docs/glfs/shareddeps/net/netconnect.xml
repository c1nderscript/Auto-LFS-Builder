  <title>Connecting to the Internet</title>

  <para>
    The LFS book covers setting up networking by connecting to a LAN
    with a static IP address. There are other methods used to obtain
    an IP address and connect to a LAN and other networks (such as
    the internet). The most popular method is DHCP.

    DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is a
    protocol used by many sites to automatically provide information
    such as IP addresses, subnet masks and routing information to
    computers. If your network uses DHCP, you will need a DHCP client
    in order to connect to it.

    <para>
      In order to use DHCP, you will need a DHCP client,
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/dhcpcd.html">
      dhcpcd</ulink>. You may also be wanting to connect to the
      internet wirelessly. In order to do that, you should first
      configure the kernel to support that, the instructions for
      that being at
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/wireless-kernel.html"/>.
      After that, you will need a tool to connect to the internet, suitable
      ones being
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/iw.html">iw</ulink>,
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/wireless_tools.html">
      Wireless Tools</ulink>, and
      <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/basicnet/wpa_supplicant.html">
      wpa_supplicant</ulink>.
      You will only need one of those, whichever one is up to you.
