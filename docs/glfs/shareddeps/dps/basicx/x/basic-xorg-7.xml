  <para>
    <application>Xorg</application> is a freely redistributable,
    open-source implementation of the <application>X</application> Window
    System. This system provides a client/server interface between display
    hardware (the mouse, keyboard, and video displays) and the desktop
    environment, while also providing both the windowing infrastructure and a
    standardized application interface (API).
  </para>

  <para>
    This section however doesn't install <xref linkend="xorg-server"/>, but
    instead installs basic software that a lot of other software depend on,
    including the <application>Xorg</application> server, compositors, window
    managers or desktop environments, and <xref linkend="xwayland"/>.
  </para>
  
  <note><para>
    <application>Xwayland</application> is a necessary part of Wayland if you
    want to use <application>Xorg</application>-only software like <xref
    linkend="steam"/>. <xref linkend="wine"/> has an experimental
    <application>Wayland</application> mode but it is still a good idea to
    install <xref linkend="xwayland"/> for now.

  Instructions</bridgehead>

  <para>
    Xorg-7.0 introduced a completely auto-tooled, modular build system.
    With the new modular build system, it is no longer possible to download
    the entire package in a single file. In fact, there will be well over 100
    packages that need to be fetched from the download location. To assist
    with such a large task, installing <xref linkend="wget"/> is strongly
    recommended for downloading the needed files.  A complete
    <application>wget</application> file list is provided for each page
    that includes multiple packages.
  </para>

  <para>
    Given the number of packages available, deciding which packages you
    need to install for your particular setup may seem a bit overwhelming at
    first.  Take a look at <ulink url=
    "https://wiki.x.org/wiki/ModuleDescriptions">this page</ulink>
    and <ulink url=
    "https://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-modular/2005-November/000801.html">
    this thread</ulink>
    to get an idea of what you will need.  If you are unsure, you should
    install all packages at the cost of extra disk space.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      Even if you intend to download only the necessary packages, you
      should download the wget file lists.  The list of files are ordered by
      dependency, and the package versions listed in the files are known to
      work well with each other. Further, the wget file lists contain comments
      for specific packages that are deprecated or are not recommended to
      install. Newer packages are likely intended for the
      next release of <application>Xorg</application> and have already proved
      to be incompatible with current versions of software installed in GLFS.
      The installed size of <application>Xorg</application> can be reduced
      considerably by installing only the packages that you will need and use,
      however, the GLFS book cannot account for all dependencies and build
      options for the individual <application>Xorg</application> packages.
      The instructions assume that all packages have been built.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
    Additionally, because of the large number of repetitive commands,
    you are encouraged to partially automate the build. Instructions have been
    given that utilize the
    <ulink url="&blfs-svn;/postlfs/sudo.html">sudo</ulink> package.
    It is recommended that you use the <parameter>:NOPASSWD</parameter>
    configuration option for the user that will be building the xorg packages.
    There are other accommodations in the off chance you didn't install it.
    You can use the <command>su</command> utility, invoking <parameter>-c
    </parameter>. This requires that you enter your password each time a
    package needs to get installed. The last accommodation is allow you
    to build and install each package as the <systemitem class="username">root
    </systemitem> user. This is not recommended but is an option if you
    don't want to install <application>sudo</application> and don't want
    to type a password again and again.

    <para>
      Set the <envar>XORG_PREFIX</envar> variable for compatibility with BLFS
      with the following command:
    </para>

    <screen><userinput>export XORG_PREFIX="/usr"</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>The <envar>XORG_PREFIX</envar> variable will not be used in this
      book, but it is a necessary variable to set if you intend to follow
      certain BLFS instructions. If you aren't just copy and pasting BLFS
      instructions, you may do without the variable but be sure to replace
      the variable in the instructions with <filename>/usr</filename>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Throughout these instructions, you will use the following
      <command>configure</command> switches for all of the packages. Create the
      <envar>XORG_CONFIG</envar> variable to use for this parameter
      substitution:
    </para>

<screen><userinput>export XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
    --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"</userinput></screen>

    <note>
      <para>
        The instructions below depend on the files created in
        <xref linkend="bash-profile"/>.
      </para>
    </note>

    <para>
      Create an <filename>/etc/profile.d/xorg.sh</filename> configuration
      file containing these variables as the &root; user:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh &lt;&lt; EOF
<literal>XORG_PREFIX="/usr"
XORG_CONFIG="--prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --disable-static"
export XORG_PREFIX XORG_CONFIG</literal>

chmod 644 /etc/profile.d/xorg.sh</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      If you've installed <application>sudo</application>, ensure that
      <envar>XORG_CONFIG</envar> is available
      in the <application>sudo</application> environment. As the
      <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user, run the following
      command:
    </para>

<screen role="root"><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/sudoers.d/xorg &lt;&lt; EOF
