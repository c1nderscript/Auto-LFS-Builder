  <title>Binary Support</title>

  <para>
    Now that have <application>Steam</application> and/or
    <application>Wine</application>, you now have decent support for running
    binary only applications. However, there are AppImages and Flatpaks. This
    book does not and will not go over how to get that support. However, you
    can figure out how to get that support by looking at another project the
    GLFS development team works on:
    <ulink url="&slfs-website;">SLFS</ulink>. The
    specific section you will want to see to get that support is
    <ulink url="&slfs-website;/binary/binary.html">
    Binary Support</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
    After following the instructions, you should be able to run AppImages and
    use Flatpak. You can even use Flatpak to install
    <application>Steam</application> if you wish. That method is not covered in
    this book.
