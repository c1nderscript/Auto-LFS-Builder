  <title>Gamepad Support</title>

  <para>
    Gamepads, or more widely known as game controllers, can be used with many
    applications and games. However if you compiled the kernel yourself, the
    kernel drivers for gamepads are likely not enabled. Go ahead and enable
    the kernel options below and recompile the kernel if necessary.

    Now you should be able to plug in your gamepad and play. If you want to use
    the gamepad wirelessly, you will need to connect it via Bluetooth. You can
    enable Bluetooth by following the BLFS page <ulink
    url="&blfs-svn;/general/bluez.html">BlueZ</ulink> if you haven't already
    compiled it. If you have chosen to install a desktop environment, if not
    already done, you can likely install a bluetooth application specific to
    the desktop environment.
