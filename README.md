# Auto-LFS-Builder

An automated linux from scratch builder.

This script builds:

Linux from Scratch

Beyond Linux from Scratch

Gaming on Linux from Scratch


All in one application.

Each builder, installer, and validator script now determines its own
location when sourcing helper files. This means you can execute any of
these scripts from any directory and they will locate their required
helpers correctly.
See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for environment configuration details.
