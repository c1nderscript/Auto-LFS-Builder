An automated linux from scratch builder.

## Updating Documentation Sources

Run `scripts/update_docs.sh` to pull the latest versions of the LFS, BLFS, JHALFS and GLFS documentation. If any of the repositories receive updates, the script triggers regeneration of the build scripts (placeholder implementation).
